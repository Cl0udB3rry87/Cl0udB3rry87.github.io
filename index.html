            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Hi, I'm @Cl0udB3rry87 aka Jesse!  I have had passion and love for technology since I was a little kid.  Some of my earliest memories are of my mother telling me not to touch the computer in her office.  I also played a lot of video games as a kid.  Through my quest to play video games I taught myself Apple Basic when I was eight and did not know it until I took a QBasic class in high school.  During my senior year of high school I was introduced to Linux in an Astronomy class.  I have been using Linux every since and for the last few years it has become my OS of choice.  With it comes years of expeience with Linux.  I am not an expert but I do know quite a bit.  I also have years of experience working in IT Support and Tech Specialist roles.  With the expeirience I have it is assumed that I have a tech degree but I actually have a BA in Anthopology.  I am proud to have my degree.  I learned and aquired skill that I never would have if it were not for my professors in my Anthropolgy department.  The biggest things I learend were how to read, write, and communicate with others.</p>
